This repo is for the workshop on "Building Modern Single-Page Web Applications" workshop at [Frontend Masters, June 2015](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/web-apps/).

## Goals of the workshop

1. Giving you tools, knowledge and confidence to build and deploy an application from scratch.
2. Familiarizing you with basics of:
    - ES6+
    - Node.js/npm
    - Ampersand.js
    - React
    - Webpack
    - Isomorphic Rendering
    - Providing user logins using an OAuth API
    - Consuming an external JSON API
3. Putting your app on the Internet


## Taking it further

I'd encourage you to keep hacking on this and finish whatever features we didn't build. 

In addition, you may want to try adding the following: 

- Add a link to real repo
- Add validation to form
- Add user avatar
- Switch it over to login with firebase
- Write module that fetches "all" repos (using github paging API)
- Add color picker?
